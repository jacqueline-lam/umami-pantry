# Umami Pantry
This is a single page application that shows matching recipes for different pantry ingredients. It is designed to encourage freestyle homecooking with easy-to-substitute ingredients.

The app is composed of backend rails API and front-end modular JS clients, which use asynchronous Javascript to make HTTP requests to the API to get/ post data and render them to the user interface.

## Installation

Download zip from my project repository: https://github.com/jacqueline-lam/umami-pantry

    $ cd umami-pantry

If you don't have Ruby, please install Ruby version `ruby 2.6.1`.

 With Rubygems loaded, you can install all of Rails and its dependencies using the following command through the command line:

More installation instructions can be found on the [Ruby on Rails Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html#installing-rails)

Once Ruby and Rails are installed, `cd` into `umami-pantry-api` and run:

    $ gem install bundler


Bundler gem provides us access to a terminal command: `bundle install`
