    - To add nouns to your world, create models in rails
    - To show your nouns, you'll need:
        1. A controller action to send the data
        2. A fetch request to ask for the data
        3. Some JavaScript code to handle DOM-rendering
    - To make your page respond to the user, you'll need event listeners
    - To keep your code clean, you should use JavaScript classes
    - To organize your code, you can use multiple JavaScript files (don't forget to add `<script>` tags for each one!)

    ## TO DO:
    * render form for new substituion ingredient (create /recipe_ingredients)
    * validation for form inputs
    * post request to API
    * update db; create new recipe_ingredient instance
    * send data in JSON and manipulate DOM to display updated ingredients on matchingRecipes and selected Recipe

    * add indepdendent scrolling panes for ingredients (L) vs recipes (R)
    * move JS logic into separate JS objects and files
